"""Subprocess bridge to `mlagents-learn`, plus an ONNX-based sim-gate evaluator.

Phase C (Blueprint v3 §6.2) trains PPO policies inside the generated Unity twin via
ML-Agents rather than in-process. This module is the seam between that external,
long-running tool and the rest of the pipeline: it shells out to `mlagents-learn` the
same way ``deployment/qairt/convert.py`` shells out to `qairt-converter` -- gate on
``shutil.which``, wrap the subprocess call in a narrow except, and report what actually
ran rather than what happened to be on PATH.

Neither `mlagents-learn` nor `onnxruntime` is required by ``requirements.txt``; both are
lazy/optional here so the rest of the suite (and this module's own absence-path tests)
stay green without them installed.
