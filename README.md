#  What is DragVerse?

DragVerse is an **Edge AI platform** that automatically creates a **digital twin of a real-world environment**, trains an autonomous robot inside that virtual replica using **Reinforcement Learning**, optimizes the trained policy for Qualcomm Edge AI hardware, and deploys it directly onto a physical robot-without manually building simulation environments.

Instead of spending days creating simulation scenes, navigation maps, reward environments, coordinate systems, and robot policies, DragVerse generates them automatically from a simple mobile scan.

The result is a complete end-to-end pipeline:

```

```

The entire workflow is orchestrated through a simple guided web application while the majority of AI inference runs locally on Qualcomm-powered edge hardware.

#  Why DragVerse?

Training robots in the physical world is expensive, slow, and potentially unsafe.

Traditional robotics development usually requires:

- manually creating simulation worlds
- designing navigation meshes
- configuring robot environments
- writing reward functions
- creating coordinate systems
- collecting datasets
- repeatedly deploying onto hardware

This process often takes days or even weeks before meaningful robot learning can begin.

DragVerse reduces this workflow into a guided pipeline.

Using only a smartphone, DragVerse can:

✅ Capture a real environment

✅ Construct a digital twin

✅ Understand scene semantics

✅ Generate robot-ready simulation assets

✅ Train an RL policy

✅ Optimize the policy

✅ Deploy directly to Qualcomm-powered hardware

The physical environment itself becomes the simulation.

---

#  Project Vision

DragVerse aims to become an operating system for rapid robot learning.

Rather than creating robots for one specific environment, DragVerse creates environments that can immediately train robots.

Our long-term vision is:

> **Scan any environment. Generate its digital twin. Train an AI agent. Deploy it back into reality.**

No manual simulation design.

No handcrafted maps.

No custom robotics pipeline.

Just scan, train, and deploy.

---

```
Capture
      ↓
Choose Robot
      ↓
Choose AI Model
      ↓
Speak Instruction
      ↓
Choose Activity
      ↓
Deploy
```

Designed to be approachable, even if you're new to robotics.

#  Complete End-to-End Pipeline

DragVerse consists of six major stages.

## Stage 1 - Environment Capture

A Snapdragon-powered smartphone captures:

- RGB imagery
- camera poses
- IMU information
- depth estimation
- scene geometry

The captured environment becomes the foundation for reconstruction.

---

## Stage 2 - Digital Twin Generation

Captured data is transformed into:

- reconstructed scene
- semantic labels
- physics colliders
- navigation mesh
- coordinate system
- Unity environment

No manual scene building is required.

---

## Stage 3 - Robot Task Definition

Users specify:

- robot platform
- activity
- objective
- language instruction

DragVerse converts these selections into reinforcement learning configurations.

---

## Stage 4 - Reinforcement Learning

Inside Unity:

- PPO training
- reward optimization
- simulation validation
- policy export

The generated digital twin serves directly as the training environment.

---

## Stage 5 - Edge Optimization

Policies are exported to ONNX before:

- quantization
- optimization
- Qualcomm AI Hub conversion
- QAIRT deployment

This enables efficient edge inference.

---

## Stage 6 - Real Robot Deployment

The optimized policy is transferred onto the robot where it performs inference locally using Qualcomm hardware acceleration.

The digital twin and the physical robot remain spatially synchronized through ArUco-based coordinate alignment.

---

#  What Makes DragVerse Different?

Most robotics platforms solve only one piece of the pipeline.

| Existing Approach | Limitation |
|-------------------|------------|
| Simulation Platforms | Require manual world creation |
| Robot SDKs | Require robotics expertise |
| Digital Twin Software | Stops before robot learning |
| RL Frameworks | Require custom environments |
| Edge Deployment Tools | Require trained models |

DragVerse unifies every stage into one automated workflow.

It is simultaneously:

- Digital Twin Generator
- Simulation Generator
- RL Training Platform
- Edge AI Deployment Pipeline
- Robot Orchestrator

within a single application.

---

#  Research Contributions

DragVerse combines several research areas into one integrated workflow:

- Digital Twin Generation
- Edge Artificial Intelligence
- Reinforcement Learning
- Sim-to-Real Transfer
- Mobile Spatial Computing
- Semantic Scene Understanding
- Robot Learning
- Qualcomm Edge Optimization
- On-device AI Inference
- Autonomous Navigation

While each individual domain has existing tools, DragVerse focuses on automating the complete lifecycle-from environment capture to real-world deployment.

---

#  Design Principles

DragVerse is designed around five engineering principles.

### Edge First

Inference should execute on-device whenever practical.

---

### Modular

Every pipeline stage is independently replaceable.

---

### Open Source

All source code is publicly available.

No proprietary algorithms are required to reproduce the system.

---

### Hardware Agnostic

Although optimized for Qualcomm platforms, the software architecture is designed to be extensible to future robotics hardware.

---

### Reproducible

Every stage-from environment capture to deployment-can be reproduced using documented instructions and open-source dependencies.

---





#  Repository Structure

The repository is organized to keep every subsystem modular, independently testable, and easy to extend.

#  Frequently Asked Questions

## Does DragVerse require cloud connectivity?

No.

The majority of inference is designed to execute locally on supported edge hardware.

Some optional cloud services (such as multilingual online speech understanding) may be used depending on configuration.

---

## Can I use another robot?

Yes.

The robot abstraction layer allows new robot adapters to be implemented with minimal changes.

---

## Can another reinforcement learning algorithm be used?

Yes.

DragVerse is designed to be modular.

Although PPO is the reference implementation, alternative algorithms can be integrated.

---

## Can I replace Unity?

Yes.

The architecture intentionally separates simulation generation from policy training.

Alternative simulators can be integrated.

---

## Does DragVerse require Qualcomm hardware?

No.

The architecture is modular.

Qualcomm platforms provide the reference implementation and optimized execution path, but portions of the system can run on other supported hardware.
