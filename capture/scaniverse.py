"""Ingest scan exports (Scaniverse and friends) into DragVerse's PLY pipeline.

Scaniverse is an external phone-side capture app. Its exports arrive as:
- `.ply` point clouds — DragVerse's native format, but usually *binary*, not ASCII.
- `.obj` meshes — geometry taken as a point cloud; MTL/textures are ignored.
- `.glb` / `.usdz` — not supported (see ingest_export).

Everything is normalised to one ASCII PLY at `scan_dir/scaniverse.ply` so that every
downstream stage sees a single shape regardless of what the user picked.
